# Danny's FC F722 Rev.1 prototype
Flight controller in 30*30 size, with STM32F722 uC, Barometer and microSD slot - Version 1 (Prototype)

* Schematics, List of Components and Production Files - soon!

* A little about this procject:
This design has born for test purposes, and to create an alternative for hardware imported from China.
It was inspired by my favourite MatekF722 flight controller - microSD, resistors on ports, barometer and so on creates ideal setup.
At this moment 90% of features was succesfully tested in-flight (except current and rssi sense)


* If would like to buy one of the prototypes, please contact me. There are always some unnecessary boards left from the test batch. The production costs oscillates at level of 32-35 Euro and depends on the quantity of pcb's.
